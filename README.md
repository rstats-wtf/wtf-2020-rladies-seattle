Kara Woo will present a workshop on R configuration, maintaining R, and how to repeat yourself with purrr. The workshop will cover the 5th and 8th modules of the two-day What They Forgot to Teach You About R workshop (https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/what-they-forgot/).

This workshop is designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You should take this workshop if you’ve been using R for a while, you feel like writing R code is not what’s holding you back the most, and you want to learn more about your R installation.

This is a hands-on workshop, so please bring a laptop with a current version of R and RStudio installed. RSVPing helps us know how many people to expect, but is not required.

This event is NOT sponsored by The Seattle Public Library.
